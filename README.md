# LANDSAT-8-SATELLITE-IMAGERY-CLASSIFICATION-ANALYSIS-USINGU-NETDEEP-LEARNING-ALGORITHM
Satellite Imagery

Project implements a deep learning-based approach to classify and segment satellite imagery using the U-Net architecture. It enables pixel-level identification of features like roads, vegetation, buildings, water bodies, and other land-use categories. The model is designed to deliver precise results by leveraging the powerful capabilities of U-Net, making it ideal for geospatial analysis and remote sensing applications.

*Overview:*

The primary goal of this project is to automate the process of analyzing satellite images for better understanding and decision-making. By utilizing the U-Net architecture, the model provides efficient and accurate classification and segmentation for applications such as urban planning, disaster management, and environmental monitoring.

2.Classification of land-use categories like roads, buildings, vegetation, and water bodies.  
3.Efficient and accurate model performance using U-Net.  
4.Scalability to handle large satellite datasets.  

*Technologies Used :*

1.Python  
2.TensorFlow/Keras for model implementation.  
3.NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data preprocessing and visualization.  
4.OpenCV for image manipulation.  
5.Jupyter Notebook for experimentation and demonstration.  

*Dataset :*

1.The project uses publicly available satellite imagery datasets (e.g., DeepGlobe, ISPRS Potsdam, or similar datasets).  
2.Input Data: High-resolution satellite images.  
3.Labels: Pixel-level annotations for roads, buildings, vegetation, water bodies, etc.  

*How to Run :*

1.Train the U-Net model using the notebook or scripts provided in the notebooks/ or models/ directory.  
2.Evaluate the model on test images.  
3.Deploy the application:
